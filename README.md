# The_Last_Breath_2.0
A text-based role-playing game developed in Swift.

I rewrote the story of the game created in Java in my first semester at university for a Swift language project at the Apple Developer Academy. The basis of the story remains the same, but this time with more path options and different endings according to the player's choice of action during the game. 

Synopsis: The story is based on a plot full of mystery and magic, where you will travel in search of the cure that will save your sister from a curse cast by a powerful wizard. During this journey you will face various obstacles and challenges that will awaken hidden abilities within you.
